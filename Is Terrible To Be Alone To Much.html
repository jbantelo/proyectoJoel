   <h1><i>Is Terrible To Be Alone To Much</i></h1>
Sitting in my chair, listening to "Gloomy Sunday" while writing this shit on html 
<br>I was wondering how it will feell to be dead... 
<br>cease to exist! haha I remembered that song from Suicide Silence 
<br>GREAT! yes it would be fuckin' great 
<br>sometimes I feel so fucking empty in my inside, but just sometimes... 
<br>at least music is always there, otherwise I would have committed suicide long time ago 
<br>what is the meaning of life? 
<br>my mom always said that God has put me on this shitty earth with a purpose and I have to find it 
<br>haha I have been brainwhased since I was kid with all that stuff. 
<br>so... what's my purpose? 
<br>maybe to be a millonaire like my friend Jb haha 
<br>in fact, it would not hurt me some money. 
<br>Do you want to know what first I would like to do with the money? 
<br>simple, help my poor mother with all her debts, fuck it really breaks my heart to see her so sad and worry about that shit all the time. 
<br>She can't sleep or even eat well at lunch, holy shit my mother has worse problems than my stupid depression. 
<br>it's 22:45 and it's cold, I like the weather but mosquitoes don't let me sleep, fuckin' mosquitoes. 
<br>Have you ever listened to Uaral? Damn! is one of my best depressive folk black metal if I can call it that way hahaha... 
<br>The band's integrants are just two brothers from chile, they never make a live presentation, well that's what I heard. 
<br>Actually, I thinks they did presentations but just for a selected few people or something like that 
<br>Why I like their music? Well, I love DSBM (depressive suicidal black metal) but this band is different you know... 
<br>their lyrics talks about their life, they used to live outside the city, in the fields, very humble people. you can listern the sound of the rain and birds in their songs. 
<br>Although I find this kind of music fascinating and interesting, some people say wtf is that? like my friend maria haha, I suppose it is not for everyone 
<br>I wish I have someone to share this music. Well, I have Eduardo but he doesn't like black metal to much, so DSBM is defenetely not his style haha 
<br>BLACK METAL HAS RUINED METAL HAHAHA... BLACKERS, STUPID BLACKERS LMAO! 
<br>Eduardo likes more thrash and death and so do I, we've been friends since 2014 I guess, we met in a stupid guns n' roses fan club, can you believe it? 
<br>the funny thing of that fan club was that the leader wanted us to gather with other fan clubs in order to meet new people and make friends and stupid things like that 
everything was ok until she said that there would be justin bieber, tokio hotel, one direction fans club hahaha WHAT THE FUCK?! seriously? fuck this shit I'm out and most of the group also leave 
<br>it's impossible right, how can we share our music with those guys, no way. 
<br>but if it wouldn't for that group I would never have the chance to meet Eduardo 
<br>so... since that day we became good friends, we have gone to many concerts and headbanged a lot until our necks were dislocated... 
<br>In 2015 new years eve, I was in his house, that practically was the last day I drank alcohol because I drank a lot fuck... what happened that day with me? 
<br>anyway, Eduardo puts some music in his laptop, he had a big guitar amplifier and he connected it with the laptop and the party begun 
<br>we were listening death,heavy,thrash to loud, damn it was good. He said their neighbors didn't care haha. After a while a couple friends of him arrive 
<br>I was kind of drunk at that moment but not to much, we were drinking wine I think, we finished two bottles and then we bought vodka and we drank it with sprite, I don't remember that much haha 
<br>Walter and Flor were the names of the couple. he was wearing a t-shirt with dimebag darrell's face and jeans with cuts. 
Flor was with a violet blouse a jeans with cuts as Walter. 
<br>They seemed to be very quiet, sitting next to me talking each other while I was changing the music 
<br>oh wait! I remember when I put some Pantera's songs he turned to me and said "fuck yeah man" that's music and I agreed. 
<br>then we start a disscusion about which pantera's song was the best 
<br>Pantera is one my favorite thrash metal bands, so where I could start?, I was thinking a lot.. and then, 
<br>"COWBOYS FROM HELL", I said. 
<br>play it dude, he replied. 
<br>after an hour, I was dancing,singing and headbanging with these dudes haha, we were in our metal world feeling the music, I almost cry. This is my place. 
<br>Flor was choosing the music and watching us acting like idiots. 
<br>Suddenly, I was feeling very tired I wanted to sleep, so Eduardo took me to his bed, I closed my eyes and that was all. 
<br>I woke up a little over 8:00 am with pain in my stomach. FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK!!!! 
after I got up I realized I had vomited all over the bed, eduardo will kill me! 
<br>I walked down stairs and I asked myself, where is these people? I went to the bathroom and when I opened the door slowly I saw a face. 
<br>EDUARDO! what the hell man? he was lying on the floor like a baby. 
<br>he looked at me and said, UUUUGH??? 
<br>haha, finally he got up and we had breakfast... 
but I couldn't eat anything. To illustrate, I began to throw out all the alcohol, yup I got sick. 
<br>fuck it, it was worth it. 
<br>We went to many brutal concerts but the best I had until now... was torture squad performance... 
<br>Damn! that woman I swear, I fell in love the first time I saw her, beautiful eyes, wonderful hair and of course brutal voice she has. 
PANDEMONIUM!!!
    <h1>Smoke a lot of pot</h1>
Everything is nice, my head is spinning, my eyes are burning, I can feel all the mocus inside my nose
    <br>
    When I close my eyes is worse, I feel like everything is going off.For instance, when I wake up is like 30 years passed.
    <br> my ears are screwing me, I almost hear nothing.
    <br>My head hurts, and now my ears are super sensible
    <br>Another round?
    <br>Lets try, and lets hope I can remember all of it.
    <br>WAIT! i came back
    <br>I started to feel super down, yeap my head is worse than 5 minutes ago, I guess. HAHAHA(sarcasm).
    <br>I am hearing sounds from outside, is like a family reunion laughing but very hard.
